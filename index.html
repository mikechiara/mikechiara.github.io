          <p>

          I am from Floral Park, New York. I recently graduated Cum Laude from Fairfield University's Dolan School of Business,
          where I am majored in Information Systems and minored in Business Analytics and English Creative Writing.
           After graduating from Fairfield, I completed Columbia University's <a href="http://sie.sps.columbia.edu/">Sports Industry Essentials</a>
            Certificate Program, where I have taken classes on Sports and Big Data, Sports and Digital Media, The Global Expansion of Sports, and other topics.
          </p>
          <p>

Through experiences in and out of the classroom, I've begun to realize work in creative fields interest me the most.
As I begin my career, I am currently looking for opportunities in the fields of Entertainment, Film, Media, Sports, and Technolgy.
I intend to attend graduate school in Fall 2019 in order to pursue a Master's Degree in Media Management.

            <p> As an intern with Shutterstock's Media Team, I developed and managed Paid Media Campaigns for multiple platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Linkedin, and Criteo.
              This often required cleaning, compiling, and systematizing thousands of data daily into budget pacing documents.
              I also aided the Affiliate Marketing Team with data visualization and digital storytelling for presentations to partners.
               Best of all, I got to do all of this while working in the iconic Empire State Building. It's not stock, it's Shutterstock!

             how to communicate design through deliverables such as personas, sitemaps, wireframes, and flowcharts, and about working for a client.

        <h6> Managing Editor, Project Manager</h6>
        <h6> September 2017- May 2018</h6>
        <p> Without a doubt, the academic highlight of my senior year was my work on
          <i>Dogwood</i>, Fairfield's literary magazine. As a Managing Editor, I read
          hundreds of submissions and judged them based on both quality and aesthetic fit.
          I also had the privilege of working firsthand with authors to make sure their creative vision was actualized
           in the formatting of the work in the magazine. Finally, I aided in the production and formatting of the magazine using InDesign.
        </p>
        <p>
          For my Information Systems Capstone Project, I was able to use my business and technical
          acumen to give back to the magazine by leading in a redesign of <i>Dogwood's</i><a href="https://dogwoodliterary.com"> website</a>.
          I conducted a competitve analysis of similar sites to establish design themes and then made
          design mockups and wireframes to demonstrate those themes to the client. Once the site was successfully
          transitioned, I trained the client in site maintenance, consulted the client in Digital Marketing, and
          developed a content schedule for the release of <a href=https://dogwoodliterary.com/buy/><i>Dogwood's</i> 2018 issue</a>.

          During the 2018 <a href="https://hashtagsports.com/">Hashtag Sports</a> Conference in Times Square, New York, I served as a volunteer.
          I assisted the Hashtag Sports team with various event coordination tasks, including orchestrating
          the check-in of hundreds of attendees, seating audience members for speaker sessions, and
          running microphones for speaker Q&A. While off shift, I was able to attend talks on
          Multiculturalism, Big Data, Digital Storytelling, and PR in Sports.

             <p>
               During my college years, I've discovered that writing is a passion of mine. As a Creative Writing Minor at Fairfield University, I took classes on Poetry, Creative Nonfiction, Screenwriting, and the World of Publishing. Outside of the classroom, I have been able to hone my writing skills by writing about soccer on Twice A Cosmo and Box to Box Football. I hope one day to be published and to write movies and graphic novels as well.
